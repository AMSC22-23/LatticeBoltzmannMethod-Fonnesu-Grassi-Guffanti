A few comments:
 - you've sketched a nice readme, try to fill it, even briefly
 - eigen it's an header only library, i would expect to find it in include/ (for example, on linux it is usually in /usr/include/eigen3)  Anyway it's a very good choice
 - better state in the readme also that you're using submodules, so one can choose consciously what to do when cloning your repo, and maybe also why you're using them for eigen instead of relying on mk modules version
